Data architecture is no longer a technical discipline — it is a strategic capability. Organizations rise or fall based on how well they model, govern, move, store, and activate data. Yet most architects are trained in fragments: a little modeling here, a little cloud there, a little governance somewhere else.
This workbook fixes that.
It gives you a complete, end to end architecture education — the kind that senior architects, principal engineers, and enterprise leaders actually use in the real world.
It is:
•	Practical — every concept is tied to real systems
•	Structured — every question follows the same signature format
•	Strategic — architecture is always tied to business outcomes
•	Reusable — patterns, templates, checklists, and frameworks
•	Interview ready — every section ends with a summary you can speak confidently
This book is the culmination of years of teaching, building, leading, and refining architecture across industries, platforms, and teams.
It is not meant to be read once. It is meant to be used, referenced, taught, and applied.
Welcome to your next level.
